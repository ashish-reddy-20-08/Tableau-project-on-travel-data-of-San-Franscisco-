# Tableau-project-on-travel-data-of-San-Franscisco-
- This is project on the **Air travel data analysis**, done in **Tableau** software.<br/>
- In this project, I have created a dashboard for the San Francisco airport which depicts the entire travel locations from that airport and top routes and number of flights and   all other meaningful information.  
- This dashboard consists of the total number of flights, the chart showing the least and highest average number of flights travelling per day, the most popular day of the       airport, and a map which shows the view of all the flights travelling from San Francisco to other parts of the world, top 5 routes from San Francisco and the top 5 average     distances.
- I have created the calculated fields such as grouped route, route-1, route-2, distance, from, to, number of records and line. 
- I have initially created the worksheets for all the required visualization that I need to show in my dashboard and then later organized my dashboard.
